        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img class="photo" src="img/ice-cream.jpg">
        <p>Hi! I'm Dom, from London.</p>
        <p>I studied Biomedical Sciences at Oxford, and recently left my job in digital advertising, which I was working in
            for 18 months. I'm very keen to pursue a career in web/software development.</p>
        <h4>Relevant experience</h4>
        <p>My relevant experience is quite limited, but I've got the prerequisites down!</p>
        <p>When I was a teenager, I ran a few small sites (primarily on WordPress) to make some pocket money, and helped my
            grandpa to adapt a template to create a simple website for his clinic.</p>
        <p>At university, I managed to create (read: hacked together) a small Python script to help me to analyse a batch of
            cell images taken for my research project. I'm still surprised that it worked!</p>
        <p>More recently, I came up with an example landing page with Bootstrap to give a client a more tangible example of
            my proposals for improving their customer engagement (e.g. putting a small form in a modal window instead of
            directing users to a new page to fill it out). This was very much hacked together and took plenty from a template,
            so it wasn't the most technically-demanding task!</p>
        <h4>Hobbies &amp; things I care about</h4>
        <p>I care a lot about mental health due to obstacles I've faced, and major struggles I've seen others go through. I
            have also become much more interested in education over the years. Attending university is still such a privilege,
            and - for some - it can also be an unhealthy, unproductive environment. This is one area that I believe communities
            like F&amp;C and even MOOCs can come in, helping to provide (more) accessible, viable, meritocratic/democratic
            options for self-development in a different environment to a typical school or university.</p>
        <p>I'm a big fan of electronic music (especially if it's a little weird or ambient), but also enjoy listening to Jazz
            &amp; Romantic-era classical music. I play the Cello and Flute, but am very out of practice. Despite my love
            of music, I prefer to listen to podcasts while I commute, so feel free to get in contact for some recommendations
            :)</p>
        <h4>Future plans</h4>
        <p>Web/app development as a career, and as a means to be more alturistic and entrepreneurial. I should also start to
            eat a bit less ice cream and get back into athletics...</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Why" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Why I'm Applying</h3>
        <h4>Why web development</h4>
        <p>I've been a wannabe web/software dev since I was a teenager and - despite working on a few very simple websites to
            earn pocket money - I spent most of my time watching
            <i>The Wire</i>, playing cello (or - more likely - video games) or getting injured on the rugby pitch.</p>
        <p>I was diagnosed with
            <a href="https://goo.gl/4wztSq" target="_blank">dyspraxia</a> once I got to university, and - before this point - I spent a lot of my life believing that I wasn't
            "creative" due to a mix of my poor artistic ability and some anxiety issues.</p>
        <p>I was wrong. I
            <i>am</i> creative. I notice opportunities to improve services, products and websites, and now I just need to develop
            the skills to express that creativity effectively. I do still suck at painting and drawing, though.</p>
        <p>These skills will also enable me to be more alturistic (something I need to improve on, especially as a white man
            with a privileged upbringing), and to make more of a difference in the areas that I care about. I have given
            back a little: going to university gave me the chance to help as part of the
            <a href="https://goo.gl/HuD9W4"
                target="_blank">Social Mobility Foundation</a>'s Personal Statement Checking Service, and working in digital advertising has
            allowed me to help to promote
            <a href="https://goo.gl/jnZYDQ" target="_blank">ClientEarth</a>'s website pro bono. There is, however, so much more that I can - and should - do.</p>
        <h4>Why now</h4>
        <p>After struggling at university, I'm in a much better place both mentally and financially. I now have the means and
            confidence to take the plunge and pursue something I've been keen to do for many years!</p>
        <h4>Why F&amp;C</h4>
        <p>Founders and Coders really does seem like the perfect course, despite being on my least-favourite tube line. I expect
            that the peer-led, project-based nature of the programme lends itself to awesome collaboration, tangible results,
            and a load of learning, as eveyone is regularly teaching new things to the rest of the group.</p>
        <p>The community vibe of F&amp;C has become more apparent with each meetup that I've attended, as well as on Gitter.
            The helpfulness and positivity of the helpers/students and my fellow 'visitors' alike have been really impressive
            and - although many of us will be disappointed to not get a place on this cohort - most people who have attended
            the evening sessions have already got so much out of F&amp;C from the meetups alone.</p>
        <h4>&#42; Congratulations &#42;</h4>
        <p>Thanks and well done for making it through my essay!</p>
