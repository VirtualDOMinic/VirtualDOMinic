My GitHub Pages site for Founders & Coders.

Updated for the April 2018 application deadline.

## Quick overview

I've aimed to make the site responsive with a mix of media queries (altering font sizes, images and flex layout) and css calc/vw units.

The tab-style navigation and header image change use vanilla javascript.

I hope you like my site :).
