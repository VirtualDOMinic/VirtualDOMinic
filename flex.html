        <h4>Another heading (h4)</h4>
        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
            Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for
            he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
            vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
            is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

            <a href="https://goo.gl/HuD9W4" target="_blank">Social Mobility Foundation</a>'s Personal Statement Checking Service, and working in digital advertising has
            allowed me to help to promote
            <a href="https://goo.gl/jnZYDQ" target="_blank">ClientEarth</a>'s website pro bono. There is, however, so much more that I can - and should - do.</p>
        <h4>Why now</h4>
        <p>After struggling at university, I'm in a much better place both mentally and financially. I now have the means and
            confidence to take the plunge and pursue something I've been keen to do for many years!</p>
        <h4>Why F&amp;C</h4>
        <p>Founders and Coders really does seem like the perfect course, despite being on my least-favourite tube line. I expect
            that the peer-led, project-based nature of the programme lends itself to awesome collaboration, tangible results,
            and a load of learning, as eveyone is regularly teaching new things to the rest of the group.</p>
        <p>The community vibe of F&amp;C has become more apparent with each meetup that I've attended, as well as on Gitter.
            The helpfulness and positivity of the helpers/students and my fellow 'visitors' alike have been really impressive
            and - although many of us will be disappointed to not get a place on this cohort - most people who have attended
            the evening sessions have already got so much out of F&amp;C from the meetups alone.</p>
