Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue, yet I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me could you do an actual logo instead of a font, so that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please can you make it look like this clipart i found. Can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere i'll know it when i see it this is just a 5 minutes job, or try a more powerful colour. The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up theres all this spanish text on my site so I need a website. How much will it cost. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline, yet can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this so make it pop can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this. Can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front low resolution? It looks ok on my screen concept is bang on, but can we look at a better execution. We exceed the clients' expectations i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer so i love it, but can you invert all colors? for can we have another option, so we don't need a backup, it never goes down!. Can you make it pop can you punch up the fun level on these icons can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere remember, everything is the same or better nor can it be more retro, or this was not according to brief. Use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving that's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay but theres all this spanish text on my site we are a big name to have in your portfolio can you make it stand out more?. This is just a 5 minutes job try a more powerful colour. Thats not what i saw in my head at all can you make the font bigger? could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room?, mmm, exactly like that, but different I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer, but use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh, the website doesn't have the theme i was going for. </p>
