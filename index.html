                <p>I studied Biomedical Sciences at university. It was interesting and challenging, but the world of academia
                    and research is not for me. I had a great time creating a small Python script to analyse a load of images
                    for my final year project, however!</p>
                <br>
                <p>After university, I joined Brainlabs, a digital advertising company, with the intention of moving into their
                    tech team and learning on the job. Once there, I discovered that, while there were plenty of small scripting
                    tasks to be done, there was a good chance that I wouldn't get much (or any) exposure to design, back-end
                    work or creating a large project in this environment. With this in mind, I started to look for alternatives,
                    and found FAC!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite deciding not to move into the tech team at the company, I still managed to challenge myself as an
                    Account Manager; attending several of the tech team's weekly talks, helping colleagues with some JS debugging,
                    and creating a functional mockup landing page for an important client to demonstrate the features and
                    design changes that I had been suggesting to them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a little under a year there, I knew that I would eventually leave to pursue web development, and managed
                    to get part-time work in addition to my full-time job to help me save up enough money to leave and pursue
                    this properly.</p>

                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <img src="img/music2.jpeg" alt="music stock image">
                <p>I care a lot about mental health due to obstacles I've faced, and major struggles I've seen others go through.
                    I have also become much more interested in education over the years. Attending university is still such
                    a privilege, but it is definitely not the right environment for everyone. These two issues mean that
                    I think bootcamps/communities, MOOCs and apprenticeships are going to be increasingly valuable over the
                    coming years. I'd love to use the skills I'd pick up from this course for these two causes (education
                    and mental health) in some way. Participating in the
                    <a href="https://goo.gl/HuD9W4" target="_blank">Social Mobility Foundation</a>'s Personal Statement Checking Service was really rewarding, but I know
                    that I could do more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm a big fan of electronic music (especially if it's a little weird or ambient), but also enjoy listening
                    to Jazz &amp; "Impressionist"/Romantic-era classical music. I play the Cello and Flute, but am very out
                    of practice. Despite my love of music, I prefer to listen to podcasts while I commute, as you'll find
                    out when you see my project!</p>

        <h3>Why This Course?</h3>
        <p>I'll keep this brief, as I'm sure it'll come up in the interviews, if I make it!</p>
        <div class="flex-cont three">
            <div class="three-col">
                <h4>Values</h4>
                <p>I love that FAC has clearly managed to foster such a great community, be it in the meetups or the cohorts
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The democratic/meritocratic nature of the application process (and the lack of prohibitive fees) means that
                    anyone lucky enough to get on the course can rest assured that they'll be surrounded by a really talented
                    and diverse group. Who wouldn't be excited about that?!</p>
                <br>
                <p>The emphasis on open source values and "giving back" is also very laudable, and I'd be very excited to be
                    a part of it (see the "opportunities" section).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="three-col">
                <h4>Opportunities</h4>
                <p>Spending time mentoring the next cohort, teaching other groups (as I've witnessed at space4, just before
                    the Monday evening meetups) and working on portfolio projects (possibly with non-profits) will be a great
                    way for me to not only give back, but to solidify my own knowledge.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Following on from the above, I'd absolutely love to help mentor in both Nazareth and Gaza after this course.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, dwyl looks like it would be my ideal place to work. I am really keen to get proficient at developing
                    MVPs due to my own longer-term entrepreneurial ambitions. It also looks to be a company that really fosters
                    an environment of learning, e.g. some people at dwyl have pulled together learning resources for Elixir,
                    which is a language I'm planning to pick up after I have the fundamentals and full-stack JS experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="three-col">
                <h4>Syllabus</h4>
                <p>I'm very keen to learn full-stack JavaScript, and this is one of the few bootcamps that has a focus on this,
                    rather than using Ruby/Rails, which I feel is less "cutting-edge".</p>
                <br>
                <p>More importantly, the peer-led, collaborative, project-focused setup is exactly the sort of environment that
                    I believe I would learn - and help others to learn - well in.</p>

                <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
                <img src="img/codewars.svg" alt="codewars logo">
                <p>Since completing the prerequisites, I've enjoyed helping others get to grips with freeCodeCamp and Codewars
                    at the weekly meetups, and have also created a couple more kata, one of which was quite challenging to
                    actually implement, but helped me to improve my RegEx knowledge and get a glimpse of the value of TDD.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As for fCC, I've completed some of the more advanced scripting challenges, but look forward to completing
                    them all over the coming weeks. I also had a great time making my podcast project, which was inspired
                    by a couple of the ones on the fCC curriculum.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Aside from fCC, Codewars and reading around in general, I've been dipping my toes in C and CompSci fundamentals
                    via EdX's CS50, and keeping my JS sharp thanks to tutorials from Wes Bos and "The Net Ninja". I also
                    recently started to use Scrimba, created by FAC's own Per Borgen!</p>

                <h4>Podcast Project</h4>
                <img src="img/pocketcasts.svg" alt="pocketcasts podcast app logo">
                <p>I absolutely love podcasts. It's great to feel like I'm learning during "dead time" like commuting and cleaning,
                    and to give my eyes a rest. As you'll see in the readme for the
                    <a href="https://github.com/VirtualDOMinic/podcasts" target="blank">project repo</a>, I've listened to a lot of them, and am subscribed to a healthy 140!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I saw the fCC "Random Quote Machine" and "Weather API" challenges, and thought I would merge them with my
                    love of podcasts to make my
                    <a href="https://virtualdominic.github.io/podcasts/" target="blank">Random Podcast Machine</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's not the prettiest, but it's responsive and written without any libraries or frameworks. It also has
                    a tweet functionality, history displayed at the bottom, and some great podcast recommendations covering
                    topics like coding, news, politics and technology. This is just a small sample of my podcast subscriptions,
                    so feel free to ask for more recommendations :).</p>
